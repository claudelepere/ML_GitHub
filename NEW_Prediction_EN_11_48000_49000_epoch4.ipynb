CONTEXT / INTRODUCTION This specific contract is for the provision of consulting services for the DIGIT B1 unit. The unit deals with decision making process projects, in particular e-Greffe, CIS-Net, Vista, ECI, Argus and NOAH, and document management projects, in particular Hermes, ARES, Nomcom and HRS: The e-Greffe application participates in the decisional process of the Commission, being the joint point of the procedures coming from different sources. This application mainly enables the submission of acts and their successive revisions in an electronic way. The Argus project supports the European Commission in the establishment of a general rapid alert system in order to enhance the capacity of the institution to react quickly, efficiently and in a coordinated manner to multi-sectorial crisis that require actions at the European level. The NOAH application is a tool supporting the implementation of the business continuity plans of the Commission. The Vista application is a communication system internal to the commission enabling to publish all official documents and procedures. The ECI project supports European citizens in taking the initiative of inviting the Commission to submit any appropriate proposal on matters where they consider that a legal act of the Union is required for the purpose of implementing the Treaties. The ECI project serves as a platform between the Commission, the organisers of citizens' initiatives and the citizens and allows the organisers to register their proposed citizens' initiative. The goal of the CIS-Net project is to provide an in-house workspace for managing the interservice consultation procedure including the managing of the related documents and supporting the workflow defined by the business processes. The e-Domec project roadmap towards the e-Commission has as objectives to ensure traceability of records & files (docs), along their life cycle, inside the institution, to improve transparency and increase efficiency. Ares is a new e-Domec application serving as a general register for the Commission and offering via a Web front end the following functional document management modules (registration, filing, security, single repository, workflow, e-signataire and search). Hermes Repository Services is a new e-DOMEC application which allows client application to integrate with the common repository of documents as opposed to Ares which is intended to be used only by end-users via a web browser. Ares and Hermes Repository Services are built on top of Hermes/EDCS which consists of a set of services that allow applications to access the Documentum Repository, using DFC and DQL according to the security rules in place. Nomcom is another application part of the e-Domec suite that manages the Filing Plan of the European Commission. Nomcom's interface is built using Documentum WDK and Webtop and is to be refactored using ExtJS and JAX-RS. Note: Some activities could have to be performed in the context of the ISA program, a European Commission program on interoperability solutions for European public administrations, within the scope of the above mentioned projects.

            "text: PYRAMID - Analyst / Developer SS7 Signalling (Python / SQL / BI) SIGNALLING / DATAWAREHOUSE PYRAMID Description: In the context of a strategic analytics project based on huge volumes of real-time signalling data (SS7 and GRX), we are looking for an expert to work on the inflow of data into the data warehouse system. This real-time signalling data is coming from an SS7 and IP probing platform in a feed that is decoded and enriched by home-grown software developed in the Python language. After this step, the data passes through a Sybase Event Stream Processor platform where it's aggregated in-memory before being loaded into the data warehouse. Many new reporting requirements from the business have been captured. You will have to understand these requirements, determine the changes to be made to the source feed (e.g. new fields needed from the MAP signalling messages, new enrichments) and implement these changes in the Python decoding layer and in the Sybase ESP aggregation layer. Skills: Telecom signalling skills: deep understanding of the SS7 protocols in the mobile data and roaming areas (TCAP, MAP) and GRX (GTP-C, GTP-U protocols). Software development: 3+ years professional software development experience with Python (highly preferred) or a modern object oriented language (Java, C#, Ruby,...), with a willingness to learn Python if past experience is in another language. Experience with Sybase ESP is a plus. Relational database: good SQL skills to query existing DB's, medium modelling skills to extend existing data models when necessary. \"Best practices\"-minded (agile development practices, naming conventions, code comments, standard design patterns, ...). Languages: Fluent in English. Interested? If you are interested, thanks to submit us your most recent résumé in word format.\n",

            "text: Intrasoft - Script Developer vbscript scripting bash shell Intrasoft International Description of Tasks Application packages have to be developed and maintained. The production of the packages is based on a procedure that follows these steps: gathering required information from the development teams, the product responsible person or the product vendor (installation prerequisites, how to install and customise ...) analysis of the application installation and configuration, development of the application package (MSI or App-V), technical and integration testing on the supported platforms, move to a pre-production environment, organisation and follow-up of functional tests with key users and product management, documentation of the application package, Delivery of the accepted application package to production. It is frequently required to develop specific procedures or tools to facilitate the installation, configuration and distribution of application packages (e.g. using PowerShell, VBscript or .NET). The technical documentation of application packages is crucial, comprising user guides, documentation of procedures etc. MSI-based application packages must support the software distribution system, currently the LANDesk Management Suite. All packages must therefore be tested with this software distribution system. Application packages must be integrated in the Reference Configurations used for desktops, laptops, servers and terminal servers. System integration testing is therefore a key task and needs to be carried out with all operating system versions that are supported (Windows 7 and Windows XP on workstations, Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2003 on servers, both the available 32-bit and 64-bit editions). Existing application packages must be maintained, with regards to subsequent application releases, updates and security bulletins. All such changes must be examined and can again trigger an application package development. Support needs to be provided for the existing application packages, including problem diagnosis, resolution and reporting via the Central Helpdesk. The support is organised in an ITIL-compliant manner. An internal SharePoint-based planning and knowledgebase portal has to be administrated and maintained, as well as the internal repository of all relevant information for application packages (source code, documentation, specifications, documents, etc.). Required skills Proven experience in the abovementioned tasks is essential Excellent knowledge of Microsoft installation technologies (MSI) and related tools (e.g. InstallShield), or of Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) and related tools. Very good knowledge of the Microsoft Windows operating systems family (Windows 7, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2003). Good knowledge of the Microsoft Office products family (Office 2010, Office 2003), of Internet Explorer (IE9, IE8), and of managing application parameters using policies (local policies, GPOs). Very good knowledge of common Microsoft scripting languages (e.g. PowerShell, VBscript) and programming languages (e.g. C++, C#, VB.NET, etc ...). Expertise in software production and management and in software documentation and reporting. Familiarity with software distribution tools (e.g. LANDesk). English and/or French (spoken), technical writing skills in English and/or French. Ability to participate in multi-lingual meetings (English and French spoken), ease of communication in technical matters. Certification of ITIL for service delivery and service support is considered an asset.\n",
