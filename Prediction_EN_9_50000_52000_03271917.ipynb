            "text: Serco - Script Developer script powershell msi package app-v Serco Job Description Application packages have to be developed and maintained. The production of the packages is based on a procedure that follows these step: gathering required information from the development teams, the product responsible person or the product vendor (installation prerequisites, how to install and customise ... analysis of the application installation and configuration, development of the application package (MSI or App-V), technical and integration testing on the supported platforms, move to a pre-production environment, organisation and follow-up of functional tests with key users and product management, documentation of the application package, delivery of the accepted application package to production. It is frequently required to develop specific procedures or tools to facilitate the installation, configuration and distribution of application packages (e.g. using PowerShell, VBscript or .NET). The technical documentation of application packages is crucial, comprising user guides, documentation of procedures etc. MSI-based application packages must support the software distribution system used: LANDesk Management Suite. All packages must therefore be tested with this software distribution system. Application packages must be integrated in the Reference Configurations used for desktops, laptops, servers and terminal servers. System integration testing is therefore a key task and needs to be carried out with all operating system versions that are supported (Windows 7 and Windows XP on workstations, Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2003 on servers, both the available 32-bit and 64-bit editions). Existing application packages must be maintained, with regards to subsequent application releases, updates and security bulletins. All such changes must be examined and can again trigger an application package development. Support needs to be provided for the existing application packages, including problem diagnosis, resolution and reporting via the Central Helpdesk. The support is organised in an ITIL-compliant manner. An internal SharePoint-based planning and knowledgebase portal has to be administrated and maintained, as well as the internal repository of all relevant information for application packages (source code, documentation, specifications, documents, etc.). Profile Proven experience in the above mentioned tasks is essential Excellent knowledge of Microsoft installation technologies (MSI) and related tools (e.g. InstallShield), or of Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) and related tools. Very good knowledge of the Microsoft Windows operating systems family (Windows 7, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2003). Good knowledge of the Microsoft Office products family (Office 2010, Office 2003), of Internet Explorer (IE9, IE8), and of managing application parameters using policies (local policies, GPOs). Very good knowledge of common Microsoft scripting languages (e.g. PowerShell, VBscript) and programming languages (e.g. C++, C#, VB.NET, etc ...). Expertise in software production and management and in software documentation and reporting. Familiarity with software distribution tools (e.g. LANDesk). English and/or French (spoken), technical writing skills in English and/or French. Ability to participate in multi-lingual meetings (English and French spoken), ease of communication in technical matters. Certification of ITIL for service delivery and service support is considered an asset.

Companies call on the smarts of our technical consultants for both short and long term projects in specialized domains. Your Jobcontent You will be responsible for setting up and documenting the whole Configuration Management process. This will not be from scratch, as there is already an existing base. The development of the process will be done taking into account two important factors: The first one lies in a close cooperation with the maintenance partner of our client who, within short terms, has to manage our client's CMDB (create new CI's, update of CI data, data correction cases). For this purpose, a master CMDB is to be managed by the maintenance partner and replicated every day towards the CMDB. Our client is in a migration phase of its service management tool (HP Service Desk), now becoming obsolete, toward the new Service Manager tool. You will have to liaise with the “CI owners” within our client; these are the key team members. You will report to the Business Continuity Manager. You will establish a state of premises (the current situation). You will identify the gaps between the existing situation and the ITIL best practices. You will propose a roadmap to fill in the gaps and implement it with all the stakeholders (reviewing of the existing categories, naming/labelling of the CI's/assets, links between CI's and between CI's and services, establishing process flow). You will organise info sessions with our client in order to train and gain buy-in across the organisation. You will document and complete the Configuration Management Plan. Your deliverable will be: a process and a CMDB, both base-lined, ready to be operated and fully documented in a Configuration Management Plan Your Profile Master degree in Electronics, IT or Telecommunications or equivalent by experience. Proven technical experience of at least 5 years in the field of ICT. Knowledge and proven experience of the ITIL processes and preferably Configuration Management.

INTRODUCTION The Directorate General for Translations (DGT) has in its portfolio a number of information systems and linguistic tools, like Poetry, Suivi, Trefle, Translator Desktop, Euramis, to handle the management and the workflow of the translation requests and to support the work of the translators. Through these systems data about the DGT business are recorded in a database. These data are extracted to a datawarehouse for producing statistical and decision support reports, offered to the management via the Statsuivi statistics and reporting system. The Management Desktop (ManDesk) is the new DGT workflow system currently under development, which will replace Suivi. In connection with that, a project is ran to develop a new statistical and reporting tool - named DGTSTAT - since the old StatSuivi system will not be suitable for the new workflow system.

Job description A programme is being set up to oversee the migration of the Bank in Belgium to Windows 7 and Office 2010. It is scheduled to run through 2012 and 2013. The programme will centre on the migration of machines, users and the supported applications they use, for mainstream groups in the bank. Alongside this main effort there are a number of special cases that need to be addressed: Departments that need to migrate very quickly and have a very strong business case to do so. Departments that have over the years become somewhat autonomous and as part of the migration need to re-align with the mainstream. Specials cases of small islands of users in various countries outside of Belgium. Situations with critical applications used in the bank where the migration will create additional problems. Spin off issues arising in the mainstream programme that will need additional focus. Your profile Our client is looking for an experienced Project Manager preferably with a background in IT in a banking environment. You will need to have a strong and clear mindset and be able to focus on prioritising pressures from various interest groups to tackle their special needs. With an absolutely minimal (usually zero) impact on the mainstream programme While providing a viable solution to the group concerned. Your overall objective will be to keep all of these special cases in one portfolio, but where any specific issue is clearly growing to a proportion where it will need more detailed follow up he will work with the Programme Management Officer to launch an additional Project to cover it within the programme. You will ideally have experience in Windows infrastructures but must also be stress resistant and used to working with end users. In most cases, the special situations have arisen due to a group of individuals taking control of their own environment, to some degree, and their involvement in the programme will in effect reduce their control. You will need to be sympathetic to this change but will need to be clear in defining the rules of how the group can interact with the programme. We offer A challenging position in a fast growing company with an international presence. A stimulating working environment with a really good team spirit maintained by lots of internal events (teambuilding,...). A dynamic culture focused on personal development.

            "text: Fujitsu - Senior Analyst-Programmer (Perl) Perl, XML, batch data processing Fujitsu Technology Solutions For a project with the European Commission we are looking for a Senior Analyst-Programmer. DESCRIPTION OF TASKS The expert will focus on designing and building the \"data infrastructure\" needed for processing and storing language resources to be used for the development and optimisation of SMT engines. For this purpose the expert should: Analyse existing datasets/language resources available in databases or in structured file formats. Analyse the procedures and data-related workflows required to build and improve SMT engines, in view of setting up a highly automated chain capable of receiving or retrieving new data, converting between different formats, aligning parallel text at sentence and phrase level, and applying cleaning and filtering procedures at database or file level for building new language resources. Analyse the data-related workflows and procedures needed to compile, analyse and use user feedback and other related data (e.g. comparisons between translations of the same source text) in order to draw conclusions on approaches to engine optimisation. Specify needs and develop solutions for incremental storage and versioning of different datasets, based on sentence-aligned contents from Commission-internal and external sources. Based on the analysis above, design and implement the \"data infrastructure\" needed for processing both language resources used for building the SMT engines (including extraction, conversion, importation, filtering and cleaning) and other types of data used for optimising the engines (user feedback, test data, comparison data etc). Implement the \"data infrastructure\", exploiting fully existing mechanisms already developed in the context of the MT@EC project to support data processing for building the SMT engines and developing new procedures and mechanisms where necessary. Work in close cooperation with the MT engines development team and, where relevant, with the team responsible for Euramis, the language resource management service of DGT. REQUIREMENTS The expert must demonstrate knowledge of the following elements: minimum 10 years experience in IT, including 4 years as analyst-programmer; minimum 2 years experience in Unix/Linux shell scripting (preferably bash); minimum 1 year experience with SQL-based databases, preferably Oracle In addition, the following specific experience is required: minimum 6 years experience in Perl programming; in-depth knowledge of XML and regular expressions; extensive experience in batch data processing, preferably documents or text data. Experience in processing files/documents in different languages and Unicode will be considered as a serious asset. Knowledge of C / Pro*C development and object-oriented programming languages like Python or C++ will be also considered an asset. The tasks will be performed on the Commission's premises in Luxembourg (intra muros).\n",
